Hello!

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Political Science and Economics. My interests include the use of trade policy to achieve international goals like combating the climate crisis, managing technological competition, and fostering economic development, as well as how shifting geopolitical dynamics shape markets and electoral outcomes. 

Most recently, I was the _Intern, Trade Policy_ at the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/), supporting the work of Fellow for Trade Policy [Inu Manak](https://www.cfr.org/expert/inu-manak) and her Research Associate [Helena Kopans-Johnson](https://www.cfr.org/bio/helena-kopans-johnson). There, I was focused on the goal of delivering timely analysis and commentary on critical developments in geopolitics and trade policy.

At my university, I write for the [PROSPECT Journal of International Affairs ](https://www.prospect-journal.org/) on topics revolving around the nexus between trade and geopolitics. The role provides a platform for me to inform and educate fellow students on important contemporary issues in global affairs. I also work as a _Research Apprentice_ to Ph.D candidate [Eric Thai](https://ethai98.github.io/), supporting his project which studies the political determinants and consequences of tariff phaseouts in Free Trade Agreements.

I am the first in my immediate family to attend university. Understanding the importance of education as a force for self-empowerment and positive social change, I am committed to using my experiences to support other first-generation students on their academic journeys and making higher education more accessible to all.

Outside of my studies, I spend my time listening to R&B music, weightlifting, playing basketball, and reading. One of my favorite recent reads was _[Chip War](https://www.christophermiller.net/books)_ by Chris Miller. I welcome any book recommendations on the intersection of tech and geopolitics!
