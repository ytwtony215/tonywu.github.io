Hi!

My name is Tony and I study Economics at Columbia University. I care deeply about global trade, frontier technologies, climate change, and U.S.-China relations. The throughline that connects these interests is my desire to shape policy and business in ways that move the needle on the thorniest of contemporary political and economic issues. 

Most recently, I was the _Intern, Trade Policy_ at the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/), supporting the work of Fellow for Trade Policy [Inu Manak](https://www.cfr.org/expert/inu-manak) and her Research Associate [Helena Kopans-Johnson](https://www.cfr.org/bio/helena-kopans-johnson). There, I was focused on delivering timely analysis and commentary on critical developments in international trade policy during a time of unprecedented uncertainty.

Previously, I wrote articles for the [PROSPECT Journal of International Affairs ](https://www.prospect-journal.org/) on trade and international economics. I also worked as a _Research Apprentice_ to Ph.D candidate [Eric Thai](https://ethai98.github.io/), supporting his project studying the political determinants and electoral consequences of tariff phaseouts in Free Trade Agreements. Before that, I was a _Research Assistant_ to Professor [David Lake](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/currently-active-faculty/lake-profile.html) and Professor [Wendy Wong](https://www.wendyhwong.com/) investigating regulatory structures for the Artificial Intelligence industry.

I am the first in my immediate family to attend university. Understanding the importance of education as a force for self-empowerment and positive social change, I am passionate about supporting other first-generation students on their academic journeys and opening more doors of opportunity for disadvantaged groups.

Outside of my studies, I spend my time listening to R&B music, lifting weights, playing basketball, and reading. One of my favorite recent reads was _[Chip War](https://www.christophermiller.net/books)_ by Chris Miller. If you have any book recommendations, send them my way!
