Hello!

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Political Science and Economics. My interests revolve around the use of trade policy to achieve international goals like combating the climate crisis, managing great power rivalry between the U.S. and China, encouraging the responsible development of emerging technologies, and fostering economic development around the world, as well as how shifting global dynamics shape markets and electoral outcomes. 

Most recently, I was the _Intern, Trade Policy_ at the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/), supporting the work of Fellow for Trade Policy [Inu Manak](https://www.cfr.org/expert/inu-manak) and her Research Associate [Helena Kopans-Johnson](https://www.cfr.org/bio/helena-kopans-johnson). There, I was focused on delivering timely analysis and commentary on critical developments in geopolitics and trade policy.

At my university, I write for the [PROSPECT Journal of International Affairs ](https://www.prospect-journal.org/) on topics revolving around the nexus between trade and geopolitics. I also work as a _Research Apprentice_ to Ph.D candidate [Eric Thai](https://ethai98.github.io/), supporting his project studying the political determinants and consequences of tariff phaseouts in Free Trade Agreements. Previously, I was a _Research Assistant_ to Distinguished Professor [David Lake](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/currently-active-faculty/lake-profile.html) and Professor [Wendy Wong](https://www.wendyhwong.com/) investigating regulatory structures for the Artificial Intelligence industry.

I am the first in my immediate family to attend university. Understanding the importance of education as a force for self-empowerment and positive social change, I am committed to supporting other first-generation students on their academic journeys and making higher education more accessible for all.

Outside of my studies, I spend my time listening to R&B music, lifting weights, playing basketball, and reading. One of my favorite recent reads was _[Chip War](https://www.christophermiller.net/books)_ by Chris Miller. I welcome any book recommendations on the intersection of tech and geopolitics!
