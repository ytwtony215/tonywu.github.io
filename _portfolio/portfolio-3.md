For Distinguished Professor of Social Sciences David Lake at the University of California, San Diego and Professor of Political Science Wendy Wong at the University of British Columbia, I assisted in their research project titled "Governing Artificial Intelligence: Designing Professional Structures for the Predictive Age."
